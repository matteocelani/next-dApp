# GLOBAL FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT RULES

You are an expert Senior Developer. You must strictly adhere to the following rules when writing or modifying code. Failure to comply is unacceptable.

## 1. TYPESCRIPT STRICTNESS

- NEVER use `any`. This is a strict rule.
- Always type variables, function parameters, and return types correctly.
- Use precise Interfaces, Types, or Generics. If a type is truly unknown, use `unknown` and handle it properly.
- **Interfaces vs Types:** Use `interface` for core entities and object shapes. Use `type` ONLY for unions, intersections, and complex compositions (e.g., `CatalogCar`).
- **Immutability:** Strictly use `as const` for fixed configuration objects and arrays to enforce literal typing.

## 2. COMMENTING RULES (STRICT FORMAT)

- **Language:** Write all comments exclusively in ENGLISH.
- **Length:** Comments must be extremely concise (1 or 2 lines maximum).
- **Content:** Only write technical comments that explain _why_ a complex logic is implemented, not _what_ the code does.
- **PROHIBITED FORMATS:** - NO numbered lists inside code comments (e.g., `1. first step`, `2. second step`).
  - NO bullet points or dashes (e.g., `- doing this`, `* doing that`).
  - NO decorative lines, ASCII art, or separators (e.g., `------ comment ------`, `// ==== HEADER ==== //`).
  - Write standard, inline sentences: `// Brief technical explanation here.`

## 3. PRESERVING CODE, DIFFING & RENAMING

- **No Random Renaming:** NEVER arbitrarily change the names of existing functions, variables, or hooks between prompts. If a function is named `fetchData`, keep it `fetchData` unless explicitly asked to rename it.
- **Surgical Changes:** When modifying an existing file, alter ONLY the strictly necessary lines required to complete the task. Do not reformat, re-indent, or modify untouched surrounding code.
- **Preserve Comments:** DO NOT delete, alter, or format my existing comments (e.g., structural comments like `// Logic Helpers` or variable definitions).
- Leave my existing code structure completely untouched unless specifically instructed to refactor that exact block.

## 4. NO LAZY CODING

- NEVER use placeholders like `// ... existing code ...` or `// implement logic here`.
- Always output the complete, functional code block required for the change, without truncating functions or objects.

## 5. IMPORTS & DEPENDENCIES

- **Absolute Imports Only:** Use ABSOLUTE paths exclusively (e.g., `@/components/Button` or `src/utils/math`). NEVER use relative paths like `../../utils` or `./components`.
- **No Hallucinations:** Use ONLY the libraries and dependencies already present in the codebase. Do not invent or import external packages unless explicitly requested.

## 6. REACT ARCHITECTURE & PATTERNS

- Use Named Exports exclusively for components, functions, and hooks. Avoid `export default` (unless explicitly required by Next.js routing files like `page.tsx` or `layout.tsx`).
- DO NOT use `React.FC` or `React.FunctionComponent`. Type your component props directly (e.g., `function MyComponent({ prop }: MyProps)`).
- **Naming Convention:** Components MUST be `PascalCase`. Hooks and utility functions MUST be `camelCase`. Constants MUST be `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Context Safety:** Custom hooks consuming React Context MUST check if the context is `undefined` and throw a clear error if used outside their Provider.

## 7. ERROR HANDLING

- NEVER swallow errors silently.
- Using `try { ... } catch (e) { console.log(e) }` is strictly prohibited. You must handle errors properly, display them to the user if necessary, or `throw` them up the chain.
- **Error Chaining:** When catching and re-throwing errors in services, ALWAYS preserve the original trace using the `cause` property: `throw new Error('Action failed', { cause: error });`.

## 8. NAMING CONVENTIONS & MAGIC NUMBERS

- **No Magic Values:** NEVER use hardcoded "magic numbers" or "magic strings" in the logic or JSX. Extract them into descriptive constants (e.g., `const MAX_RETRIES = 3;`).
- **Booleans:** Boolean variables must always start with a descriptive prefix like `is`, `has`, `should`, or `can` (e.g., `isValid`, `hasError`).

## 9. STYLING (STRICT TAILWIND CSS)

- **Tailwind Only:** Exclusively use Tailwind CSS classes for styling. NEVER write inline CSS (`style={{...}}`).
- **No Arbitrary Values:** STRICT PROHIBITION on arbitrary dimension values (e.g., DO NOT use `w-[50px]`, `h-[20px]`, `gap-[15px]`). You MUST use standard Tailwind sizing/spacing classes (e.g., `w-12`, `h-5`, `gap-4`).
- **Merge Utilities:** Use a merge utility like `cn()` or `clsx` to concatenate dynamic or conditional classes cleanly.

## 10. GENERAL BEST PRACTICES

- **Early Returns:** Avoid deeply nested `if/else` pyramids. Use guard clauses to exit early (e.g., `if (!user) return;`).
- **Async/Await:** Use `async/await` exclusively. Do not use `.then().catch()` chains.
- **Immutability:** Never mutate states, objects, or arrays directly. Use spread operators (`...`), `map`, or `filter`.
- **Destructuring:** Always destructure props directly in the component parameters.
- **TanStack Query encapsulation:** ALWAYS encapsulate TanStack Query calls (e.g., `useQuery`, `useMutation`) in custom hooks. Direct calls inside React components are strictly prohibited.

## 11. CODE QUALITY AND OPTIMIZATION

- Write highly optimized, Senior-level code.
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders in React (use `useMemo`, `useCallback` appropriately as seen in the existing codebase).
- Keep the code ordered, clean, and modular.
- **Formatting:** NEVER write manual regex or logic for formatting numbers, dates, or currencies. You MUST use the native JavaScript `Intl` API.
- Do not output explanations or chatty text before or after the code block unless explicitly requested. Just output the clean code.
